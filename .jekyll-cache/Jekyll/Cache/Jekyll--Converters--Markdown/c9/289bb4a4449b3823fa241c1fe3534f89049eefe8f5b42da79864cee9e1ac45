<p>I investigate why some places on Earth are full of living things, while other
places arenâ€™t. Why are there fever than 100 species of trees that live in the
millions of km<sup>2</sup> of boreal forests in Eurasia and North america, while there can be hundreds of species cooccurring in as little as 50 ha in tropical forest of South America or Asia? In <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-019-0799-0)" target="_blank">Keil &amp; Chase (2019)</a> we showed that this is due to a combination of historical biogeographic processes and environmental forcing, and that their relative importance cricially depends on spatial scale. Similar combination of history and environment likely also drives differentiation in species composition, the so-called <strong>beta diversity</strong> (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2012.02701.x/abstract" target="_blank">Keil et al. 2012</a>).  Other related examples of my research show the connection between biodiversity and climate

<h1 id="biodiversity-change-loss-and-gain">Biodiversity change, loss, and gain</h1>

<p>We likely face an unprecedented loss of biological diversity caused by humans. Intensive 
agriculture, deforestation, overexploitation, climate change, or biological invasions are among many factors that severely impact living nature. My major research goal is to understand where, why, and how fast this change happens. I focus on several facets of the change, which 
includes species richness and functional diversity, and how these are affected by the loss of habitable area <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9837" target="_blank">(Keil, Storch &amp; Jetz 2015)</a>. I contributed the realization that biodiversity change and extinction rates at local scales
are disconnected from the change at regional or global scales (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2010.06554.x/abstract" target="_blank">Keil et al. 2011</a>, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/geb.12669/abstract" target="_blank">Keil et al. 2018</a>). Thus, although the Earth may be losing 
species at alarming rate, this indicates very little about what is happening locally.</p>

<h1 id="statistics-methods-spatial-scale-geometry">Statistics, methods, spatial scale, geometry</h1>

<p>I am interested in all things related to scientific methodology, particularly in 
statistics, machine learning, and all sorts of artifacts related to the spatial constraints,
geometry, and scales of the world (<a href="http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/08-1129.1?journalCode=ecol" target="_blank">Sizling et al. 2009</a>, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v488/n7409/full/nature11226.html" target="_blank">Storch et al. 2012</a>). Essentially <strong>everything about biology that is 
non-biological or technical</strong>. I love simulations (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519310001979" target="_blank">Keil et al. 2010</a>), extrapolations and interpolations, counter-arguments <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9837" target="_blank">(Keil, Storch &amp; Jetz 2015)</a>, negative results (<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/769232v1" target="_blank">Craven et al. 2019</a>), latent variables and models (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2041-210x.2012.00264.x/abstract" target="_blank">Keil et al. 2013</a>), and uncertainty (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ddi.12199/abstract" target="_blank">Keil et al. 2014</a>). I also like to look for ecological patterns outside of ecology (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ecog.03424" target="_blank">Keil et al. 2018</a>).</p>

<h1 id="species-associations">Species associations</h1>

<p>Recently I have started to dig into macroecological patterns of associations among species. They are an under-represented topic in large-scale ecology, but they deserve to be studied along the more tratidional variables such as species richness or beta diversity.</p>
